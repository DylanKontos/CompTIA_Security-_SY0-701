CIA TRIAD - Fundamentals of security (Sometimes referenced as the AIC Triad)

SECURITY OBJECTIVES 

1. Confidentiality - Prevent data leaks (disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems)
- Data is encrypted
- Authorized users can decrypt data (access controls)
- 2FA

2. Integrity - Messages cant be modified without detection
- Hashing / verify data using (has it been modified while it was traversing the network) (sender and receiver have matching hash)
- Digital signatures (similar to hashing)
- Certificates
- Non-repudiation (proof of integrity)

3. Availability (uptime) - Systems and networks are up and running (even with security layers)
- Redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- Patching
- 24/7 uptime!

Non-Repudiation (sign a contract, this adds non-repudiation)

- Hash // Proof of integrity (data remains same)
    - In cryptography, we use hash (fingerprint)
    - If the data changes, the hash changes! ANY change in the data

Authentication (private/public keys)
  - Proof of the source of the data
  - Doesn't need to be encrypted as nobody else can sign this. Private key for signing is owned by the signer. And verify by using the public key.

AAA Framework
- Identification (you claim to be x)
- Authentication (you can prove you are x)
- Authorization (based on the ID and Auth, what does x have access to?)
- Accounting (login time, data sent/received, logout time)
